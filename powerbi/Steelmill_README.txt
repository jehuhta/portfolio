A couple quick notes about this project: 

1. If you want to watch a video of me presenting the dashboard, here is the link for that:
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331011990842163200/

Please note that the video was intended to be for a marketing/video editing department for
the university, so the cadence and tempo is slow enough for an ordinary person to understand.

2. The data is completely anonymized (since it's real data). The project is based on a 700mb 
dataset from a real steelmill and is identifying a real issue. 

3. If you like what you see, please send me a message on LinkedIn or send me an email!
